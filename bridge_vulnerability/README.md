This is my master's degree project that I completed as part of my degree in Data Science. It utilizes data from the National Bridge Inventory, NOAA Storm Events Database, and US Census population data to develop a vulnerability score for each county in the United States.

The Jupyter Notebook 000_County_Vulnerability_v01.ipynb is a wrapper that explains the function of and executes each of the python scripts used to clean and process the datasets. The resulting scientific paper including maps of the risk factors and vulnerability scores can be downloaded here from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Co_J1ejcm1PjDSXzqr7fspOCN_hlEUKl/view?usp=drive_link)
