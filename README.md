# Data Science Projects

This repository contains my Data Science projects. These projects were completed on topics that interest me as either personal projects or as part of my master's degree in Data Science.

## [Vulnerability of Coastal Bridges](https://github.com/mattwilliams-ds/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/bridge_vulnerability)

In this project, I developed a comprehensive vulnerability scale designed to evaluate U.S. counties based on the susceptibility of their bridge infrastructure to critical factors such as population growth, storm frequency, declining structural condition, and bridge age. By integrating data from these key parameters, the scale assigns a vulnerability score to each county, providing actionable insights into infrastructure resilience. This tool can aid policymakers and planners in prioritizing resources and interventions to ensure the safety and durability of bridges nationwide.

For more details and access to the scientific paper accompanying scientific paper see my portfolio page [Vulnerability Study of Coastal Bridges](https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/vulnerability-study-of-coastal-bridges/).

Key Technologies:
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn linear & Poisson regressions
* QGIS for creating map visualizations

## [Effects of Concrete Mix Ingredients on Concrete Strength](https://github.com/mattwilliams-ds/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/concrete_mix_aging)

Here, a dataset of concrete mixes, their age, and breaking strength are analyzed to determine the effects of the varying concrete mix ingredients on the 28 day concrete strength. Concrete mixes were classified into low, medium, and high strength concretes and then their respective mix ingredient quantities were characterized and analyzed.

Key Technologies:
* Python
* Pandas & Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## [Patterns in Structurally Deficient Bridges](https://github.com/mattwilliams-ds/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/structurally_deficient_bridges)

In this project, the PySpark FPGrowth algorithm is used to identify common traits among structurally deficient bridges. Structural adequacy is determined by looking at the condition of the bridge deck, superstructure, and substructure provided in the [National Bridge Inventory](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi.cfm).

See my [portfolio page](https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/patterns-in-structurally-deficient-bridges/) on this project for more information as well as a summary video I recorded.

Key Technologies:
* Python
* PySpark
* matplotlib
* SQL
* FPGrowth Algorithm

## [Comparing Machine Learning Model Performance Predicting Customer Churn](https://github.com/mattwilliams-ds/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/customer_churn)

Key Technologies:
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Seaborn

## [Predicting Concrete Strength](https://github.com/mattwilliams-ds/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/predicting_concrete_strength)

The aim of this project was to develop a model to predict concrete strengths based on their mix indredient concentrations using scikit-learn.

For more information, see the [portfolio page](https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/predicting-concrete-strength/).

Key Technologies:
* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Numpy, Pandas
* Matplotlib & Seaborn

## [The Search for Exoplanets](https://github.com/mattwilliams-ds/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/exoplanets)

Exoplanets are planets orbiting stars other than our own. The search for them is done with numerous telescopes of a stagering variety of size throughout the world. This project explores the nature of the planets discovered, the telescopes used to find them, as well as the methods of identifying exoplanets.

See my portfolio page, [Exoplanets & Space Telescopes](https://mattwilliams-ds.github.io/gh-page/exoplanets-and-space-telescopes/) for more info.

Key Technologies:
* Python
* matplotlib
* Regular expressions
